  <p>
    Finally, things are getting real! The Snowdays selection process is over. Less than two months are left to the best
    winter event of your life! Are you ready to rock with us on the slopes?
  </p>
  <p>
    We are glad to announce you that you were selected to participate in this year’s unforgettable Snowdays edition! So,
    pack your stuff, wipe away the dust from your skis and get psychologically and physically ready to live it at the
    fullest: we are waiting for you in the wonderful Bolzano! ❤️️
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="sn-bold-blue">The total amount of tickets available for your university
      is {{currentUser.profile.allowedParticipants}}</strong>. Please
    note that from now on this number cannot be neither increased nor decreased. You received your billing, which
    has to be paid within 10th February, via email. Please stick to the deadline, otherwise your places will be given to
    the unlucky ones on the waiting list.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you already know, during the event you will take part in amazing sports and activities and you will compete
    against other universities to win the Alpine Cup and the Spirit Cup.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a brief reminder about the basic requirements your team has to meet in order to successfully enrol:
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 2vw; color: #535353;">
    <li>in your group <strong class="sn-bold-blue">there must be at least one girl and one boy who will compete in the
      ski race, and at least one
      girl and one boy who will compete in the snowboard race</strong> (but there could be more than one per
      discipline);
    </li>
    <li>
      if your group’s members are more or equal to 15 you are required to create two teams who are going to compete
      against other universities in the snow-volleyball and snow-football tournaments; if your group is composed of less
      than 15 people you can choose one among the two:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Snow Volleyball team must consist of at least 8 people (1 girl at least always on the field);
        </li>
        <li>
          The Snow Human Table Football team must consist of at least 7 people (1 girl at least always on the field).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In case you have any question or doubt, do not hesitate to contact us!<br>
    Keep pushing for Snowdays and see you in March!
